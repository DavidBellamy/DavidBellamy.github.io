description: A specification of roles that interest me
---

I am graduating in May 2023 with my PhD in Epidemiology and Masters in Biostatistics, so I am searching for jobs beginning around July 1, 2023. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning Scientist roles in industry.

Given my extensive background in deep learning, healthcare and the molecular sciences, I think I would be a great fit for roles at the intersection of these spaces, such as at <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/biotech-to-techbio">`TechBio`</a> companies like [`Generate Biomedicines`](https://generatebiomedicines.com/), [`Insitro`](https://insitro.com/), [`Dyno Therapeutics`](https://www.dynotx.com/), and [`Isomorphic Labs`](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/), as well as research groups such as the Protein Team at Meta AI (led by <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrives">`Alex Rives`</a>) and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/">`AI4Science`</a> at Microsoft Research.

I am also very interested in teams that push the frontier of deep learning forward, such as those at OpenAI, Stability.AI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and Google Research.

As for postdoctoral fellowships, I am open to any that focus on similar problems to the teams listed above.
