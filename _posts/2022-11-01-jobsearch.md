description: A specification of roles that interest me
---

I am graduating in May 2023 with my PhD in Epidemiology and Masters in Biostatistics, so I am searching for jobs beginning around July 1, 2023. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning Scientist roles in industry.

Given my extensive background in the molecular sciences, I think I would be a great fit for roles at the intersection of deep learning and biology, such as at early-stage biotech companies like [Generate Biomedicines](https://generatebiomedicines.com/), [Insitro](https://insitro.com/), [Dyno Therapeutics](https://www.dynotx.com/), and [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/). 

I am also very interested in research teams at Microsoft Research (e.g. AI4Science), Meta AI (e.g. Alex Rives' group), DeepMind, OpenAI, and Google Research/Brain.

Given my passion for Transformers and LLMs, it would also be amazing to work at Stability.AI, Anthropic or any other team pushing this frontier.

As for postdoctoral fellowships, I am open to considering one if the fit is right!
