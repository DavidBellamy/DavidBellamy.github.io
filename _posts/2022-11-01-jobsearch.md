description: A specification of what I'm searching for
---

I am officially graduating in May 2023 with my PhD in Epidemiology and Masters in Biostatistics, so I am searching for jobs beginning around July 1, 2023. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning Scientist roles in industry, especially at early-stage biotech companies such as [Generate Biomedicines](https://generatebiomedicines.com/), [Insitro](https://insitro.com/), [Dyno Therapeutics](https://www.dynotx.com/), and [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/). 

I would also be interested in comparable roles at larger (bio)pharmaceutical companies such as Amgen, Pfizer, Genentech, Vertex, and Johnson & Johnson, and ML-focused tech departments such as Google Brain, Meta AI Research, and Apple Health.

As for postdoctoral fellowships, I am open to considering one if the fit is right!
