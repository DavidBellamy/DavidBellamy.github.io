  abstract={Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of networks of interacting 'normal' and malignant cells. It is well recognized that cytokine-mediated cross-talk between normal stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular endothelial cells, immune cells, and cancer cells, influences all aspects of tumor biology. Here we demonstrate that the cross-talk between CAFs and cancer cells leads to enhanced growth of oncolytic virus (OV)-based therapeutics. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) produced by tumor cells reprogrammed CAFs, dampened their steady-state level of antiviral transcripts and rendered them sensitive to virus infection. In turn, CAFs produced high levels of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), initiating a signaling cascade in cancer cells that reduced retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) expression and impeded the ability of malignant cells to detect and respond to virus. In xenografts derived from individuals with pancreatic cancer, the expression of FGF2 correlated with the susceptibility of the cancer cells to OV infection, and local application of FGF2 to resistant tumor samples sensitized them to virotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. An OV engineered to express FGF2 was safe in tumor-bearing mice, showed improved therapeutic efficacy compared to parental virus and merits consideration for clinical testing.}

  abstract={There is debate as to whether nonprofit hospitals in the USA provide sufficient benefit to their communities to warrant their tax exemption status, an exemption previously valued at $24.6 billion nationally. Despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA) reforms, there has been minimal change in community benefit spending by nonprofit hospitals, especially in the form of charity care.3 Charity care refers to unbilled and uncollected expenses that the hospital provides for patients unable to pay for services. While several studies have evaluated the amount and value of charity care provided by nonprofit hospitals or have compared charitable spending in a specific state, recent research comparing charity care across similar for-profit and nonprofit hospitals nationally is lacking. In this study, we matched for-profit hospitals to nonprofit hospitals that share the same size, location, and teaching status, and compared charitable spending relative to total expenses.}

  abstract={The Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge based on the well-known Imagenet dataset catalyzed an intense flurry of progress in computer vision. Benchmark tasks have propelled other sub-fields of machine learning forward at an equally impressive pace, but in healthcare it has primarily been image processing tasks, such as in dermatology and radiology, that have experienced similar benchmark-driven progress. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive review of benchmarks in medical machine learning for structured data, identifying one based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) that allows the first direct comparison of predictive performance and thus the evaluation of progress on four clinical prediction tasks: mortality, length of stay, phenotyping, and patient decompensation. We find that little meaningful progress has been made over a 3 year period on these tasks, despite significant community engagement. Through our meta-analysis, we find that the performance of deep recurrent models is only superior to logistic regression on certain tasks. We conclude with a synthesis of these results, possible explanations, and a list of desirable qualities for future benchmarks in medical machine learning.}
