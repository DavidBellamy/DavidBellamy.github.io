#### [On the job market for summer '23](/blog/2022-11-01-jobsearch/)

I am a PhD candidate at Harvard University in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/">`Department of Epidemiology`</a> advised by <a href="http://beamlab.org/">`Andrew Beam`</a>. 
I develop deep learning applications for medicine, such as by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09824">expanding methods for confounding adjustment</a> or pretraining Transformers on massive electronic health records to learn patient embeddings. 

I am also a proud member of the Harvard <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/">`CAUSALab`</a>, where I work with <a href="https://twitter.com/_miguelhernan">`Miguel Hern√°n`</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKGsk9cAAAAJ&hl=en">`James Robins`</a>. 

In the past, I was a molecular biologist and have a particular interest in the use of machine learning for drug discovery and protein engineering.

<!-- interested in, what I may dare to call, the future of Artificial Intelligence. 

What does this have to do with Epidemiology? As many people have said before me, this future necessarily involves causality. And causality is the language of Epidemiology. Similarly, robust AI promises to have far-reaching consequences for our healthcare systems, and thus, for public health.

I do not subscribe to a single discipline, but rather deliberately maintain an eclectic focus, in search of big ideas from all domains. My background training is in biochemistry, molecular biology, and epidemiology, whereas I am mostly self-taught in mathematics, computer science, and statistics.   -->
