#### [On the job market for summer '23](/blog/2022-11-01-jobsearch/)

I am a PhD candidate at Harvard University in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/">`Department of Epidemiology`</a> advised by <a href="http://beamlab.org/">`Andrew Beam`</a>. 
Broadly speaking, I do medical deep learning and causal inference research. For example, I have trained Transformers on electronic health records, which can be later fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as in-hospital mortality prediction in the intensive care unit. I have also developed a novel way to adjust for unmeasured confounding by adapting the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10982">`proximal inference framework`</a> to work with neural networks.

Other projects I am preparing to publish feature: multi-task learning with Transformers, numeric embeddings for tabular deep learning, and designing "global workspace"/token spaces (akin to <a href="https://nips.cc/virtual/2022/poster/53258"> `Pix2Seq V2`</a> from NeurIPS '22) for multimodal and generalist agents like <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent">`GATO`</a>. I am a scaling law enthusiast and follow the latest tricks and trends used to build multi-billion parameter models, building them myself as well.

On the causality side, I am a member of the Harvard <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/">`CAUSALab`</a>, where I have been privileged to work with and learn from world-famous <a href="https://twitter.com/_miguelhernan">`Miguel Hern√°n`</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKGsk9cAAAAJ&hl=en">`James Robins`</a>. I have also consulted with <a href="https://artera.ai/">`Artera.ai`</a> on a causal machine learning project for precision treatment decision-making.

In the past, I was a molecular biologist for 6 years and have a particular interest in the use of machine learning for drug discovery and protein engineering. I am especially excited about lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery.

<!-- interested in, what I may dare to call, the future of Artificial Intelligence. 

What does this have to do with Epidemiology? As many people have said before me, this future necessarily involves causality. And causality is the language of Epidemiology. Similarly, robust AI promises to have far-reaching consequences for our healthcare systems, and thus, for public health.

I do not subscribe to a single discipline, but rather deliberately maintain an eclectic focus, in search of big ideas from all domains. My background training is in biochemistry, molecular biology, and epidemiology, whereas I am mostly self-taught in mathematics, computer science, and statistics.   -->
