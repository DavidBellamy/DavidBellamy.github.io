#### [On the job market for summer '23](/blog/2022-11-01-jobsearch/)

Hi there! I am a Machine Learning Scientist with deep expertise in causal inference and molecular biology. My academic work has been featured in top venues such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09824">`NeurIPS`</a>, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35792990/">`European Journal of Epidemiology`</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25894825/">`Nature Medicine`</a>. I am an experienced Python developer and can produce high-quality machine learning code, models and experimental workflows in rapid iteration cycles. I am also a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/">`Department of Epidemiology`</a> at the Harvard School of Public Health graduating in May 2023. In my PhD, I have developed deep learning methods for risk prediction in the intensive care unit as well as for causal inference in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In the past, I was a doctoral student at Harvard Medical School in molecular biology and spent 6 years conducting research in epigenetics, mass spectrometry, and virology.

<!-- I am a PhD candidate at Harvard University in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/">`Department of Epidemiology`</a> advised by <a href="http://beamlab.org/">`Andrew Beam`</a>. 
Broadly speaking, I do medical deep learning and causal inference research. For example, I have trained Transformers on electronic health records, which can be later fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as in-hospital mortality prediction in the intensive care unit. I have also developed a novel way to adjust for unmeasured confounding by adapting the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10982">`proximal inference framework`</a> to work with neural networks. -->

Other projects I am preparing to publish feature multi-task learning with Transformers, numeric embeddings for tabular deep learning, and designing global token spaces (akin to <a href="https://nips.cc/virtual/2022/poster/53258"> `Pix2Seq V2`</a> from NeurIPS '22) for multimodal and generalist agents like <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent">`GATO`</a>. I am a scaling law enthusiast and follow the latest tricks and trends used to train multi-billion parameter models, building them myself as well.

On the causality side, I am a member of the Harvard <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/">`CAUSALab`</a>, where I have been privileged to work with and learn from world-famous <a href="https://twitter.com/_miguelhernan">`Miguel Hern√°n`</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKGsk9cAAAAJ&hl=en">`James Robins`</a>. I have also consulted with <a href="https://artera.ai/">`Artera.ai`</a> on a causal machine learning project for precision treatment decision-making.

Stemming from my 6 years of experience as a molecular biologist, I have a particular interest in the use of machine learning for drug discovery and protein engineering. I am especially excited about lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery.

<!-- interested in, what I may dare to call, the future of Artificial Intelligence. 

What does this have to do with Epidemiology? As many people have said before me, this future necessarily involves causality. And causality is the language of Epidemiology. Similarly, robust AI promises to have far-reaching consequences for our healthcare systems, and thus, for public health.

I do not subscribe to a single discipline, but rather deliberately maintain an eclectic focus, in search of big ideas from all domains. My background training is in biochemistry, molecular biology, and epidemiology, whereas I am mostly self-taught in mathematics, computer science, and statistics.   -->
