I am a Harvard PhD and Research Engineer independently researching ways to improve how LLMs learn.

Previously, I was a founding AI researcher at <a href="https://lila.ai">`Lila Sciences`</a> working on scientific superintelligence.

<!-- ### Harvard PhD 
In my PhD, I built a pre-training dataset, bespoke data tokenizer for a non-canonical modality and a continuous embedding layer to adapt the Transformer to risk prediction in the intensive care unit. I also developed a neural net estimator to solve an ill-posed integral equation for causal inference in the presence of unmeasured confounding.  -->

<!-- ### Before AI
I got my start in the lab when I was 18, developing the synthesis for a large organic ligand to coordinate Rhenium and lower the energy barrier for CO2 reduction. I proceeded to work in 6 different laboratories spanning the engineering of oncolytic viruses, the epigenetics of leukemia, mass spectrometry for peptidomics, and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. I began a PhD in Molecular Biology at Harvard Medical School in 2016 simultaneously enrolling in Harvard's Neuroscience PhD curriculum but by then was already so impacted by LeCun, Bengio and Hinton's 2015 Nature paper "Deep learning" that I made the career change. Fast forward several years, I received my PhD in Epidemiology and Masters in Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in May 2023 under the supervision of <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewLBeam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">`Andrew Beam`</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianxi_Cai">`Tianxi Cai`</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kssA7YwAAAAJ&hl=en">`Leo Celi`</a>. -->

<!-- I am a PhD candidate at Harvard University in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/">`Department of Epidemiology`</a> advised by <a href="http://beamlab.org/">`Andrew Beam`</a>. 
Broadly speaking, I do medical deep learning and causal inference research. For example, I have trained Transformers on electronic health records, which can be later fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as in-hospital mortality prediction in the intensive care unit. I have also developed a novel way to adjust for unmeasured confounding by adapting the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10982">`proximal inference framework`</a> to work with neural networks. -->

<!-- On the causality side, I was a member of the Harvard <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/">`CAUSALab`</a>, where I was privileged to work with and learn from <a href="https://twitter.com/_miguelhernan">`Miguel Hernán`</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKGsk9cAAAAJ&hl=en">`James Robins`</a>. I have also consulted with <a href="https://artera.ai/">`Artera.ai`</a> on a causal machine learning project for precision treatment decision-making. Upon graduating, I joined my current company as a founding AI scientist. -->


<!-- Stemming from my 6 years of experience as a molecular biologist, I have a particular interest in the use of machine learning for drug discovery, protein engineering and the conduct of science more generally. -->

<!-- interested in, what I may dare to call, the future of Artificial Intelligence. 

What does this have to do with Epidemiology? As many people have said before me, this future necessarily involves causality. And causality is the language of Epidemiology. Similarly, robust AI promises to have far-reaching consequences for our healthcare systems, and thus, for public health.

I do not subscribe to a single discipline, but rather deliberately maintain an eclectic focus, in search of big ideas from all domains. My background training is in biochemistry, molecular biology, and epidemiology, whereas I am mostly self-taught in mathematics, computer science, and statistics.   -->
